- no-unsafe-finally - Disallows control flow statements, such as return, continue, break and throws in finally blocks.
- no-unused-expression - Disallows unused expression statements.

- strict-type-predicates - Warns for type predicates that are always true or always false. Works for ‘typeof’ comparisons to constants (e.g. ‘typeof foo === “string”’), and equality comparison to ‘null’/’undefined’. (TypeScript won’t let you compare ‘1 === 2’, but it has an exception for ‘1 === undefined’.) Does not yet work for ‘instanceof’. Does not warn for ‘if (x.y)’ where ‘x.y’ is always truthy. For that, see strict-boolean-expressions. This rule requires strictNullChecks to work properly.
